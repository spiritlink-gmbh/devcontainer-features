# Using Claude Code in devcontainers

## Requirements

This feature requires Node.js and npm to be available in the container. You need to either:

1. Use a base container image that includes Node.js, or
2. Add the Node.js feature to your devcontainer.json
3. Let this feature attempt to install Node.js automatically (best-effort, works on Debian/Ubuntu, Alpine, Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS)

Note: When auto-installing Node.js, a compatible LTS version (Node.js 18.x) will be used.

## Recommended configuration

For most setups, we recommend explicitly adding both features:

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/anthropics/devcontainer-features/claude-code:1": {}
}
```

## Using with containers that already have Node.js

If your container already has Node.js installed (for example, a container based on a Node.js image or one using nvm), you can use the Claude Code feature directly without adding the Node.js feature:

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/anthropics/devcontainer-features/claude-code:1": {}
}
```

## Using with nvm

When using with containers that have nvm pre-installed, you can use the Claude Code feature directly, and it will use the existing Node.js installation.

## Persistent configuration

This feature automatically mounts a named volume at `/claude-config` and sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/claude-config` in the container user's shell profiles. This consolidates all Claude data — including `~/.claude.json` — into a single persisted location, so credentials, settings, and login state survive container rebuilds with no manual configuration required.

The `postCreateCommand` provided by this feature fixes ownership of the volume directory after mounting.
